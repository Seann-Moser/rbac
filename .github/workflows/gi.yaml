# This specifies when the workflow should run.

  # Triggers the workflow on push events to the 'main' branch.

    # Steps define a sequence of tasks that will be executed.
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the repository code.
      # This action checks out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE,
      # so your workflow can access it.
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up the Go environment.
      # This action sets up a Go environment and caches Go modules.

          # Specify the Go version. You can change this to your desired version.

      # Step 3: Download Go modules.
      # This step ensures all dependencies are downloaded before building or testing.
      - name: Download Go modules
        run: go mod download

      # Step 4: Run Go tests.
      # This command runs all tests in your package.
      # '-v' (verbose) shows detailed output for each test.
      # './...' recursively finds and runs tests in all subdirectories.
      - name: Run Go tests
        run: go test -v ./...

      # Step 5: (Optional) Run Go linting.
      # This step uses 'golangci-lint' for code quality checks.
      # You'll need to add a '.golangci.yml' config file in your repo for this to work effectively.
      # Install golangci-lint - Removed explicit version to let the installer pick the latest compatible version.

          # If not specified, the action will try to determine the latest compatible version.
          # version: v1.59.1 # Uncomment and change if you need a specific version

          # Optional: specify the path to the .golangci.yml config file.

          # Optional: only run against modified files (faster for PRs).
          # issues-exit-code: 1 # Default is 1
